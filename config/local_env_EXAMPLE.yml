# Rename this file to local_env.yml
# Renaming will allow git to ignore this file.
#
# Add account settings and API keys here.
# This file should be listed in .gitignore to keep your settings secret!
# Each entry gets set as a local environment variable.
# This file overrides ENV variables in the Unix shell.
#
# For example, setting:
# GMAIL_USERNAME: 'Your_Gmail_Username'
# makes 'Your_Gmail_Username' available as ENV["GMAIL_USERNAME"]
GMAIL_USERNAME: 'Your_Gmail_Username',


# For the purposes of this application, Youtube API keys and Google authentication
# that should not be pushed to git should be included here.
# AFTER RENAMING, OF COURSE!
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID: 'Clients_Google_Username',
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET: 'Clients_Google_Pass'
